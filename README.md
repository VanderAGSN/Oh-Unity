# Oh-Unity
A simple idea that was a joke, but I decided - why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Because of the fact that addons of garry's mod don't work until you launch any map - I was forced to upload this addon to GitHub. To install it you just need to copy "Unity_Logo" folder to your addons folder
located in... 
"Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons"
Enjoy
